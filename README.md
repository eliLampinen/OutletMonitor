 ## Outlet monitor

 I found an online store that offers incredibly well-priced outlet products. Instead of doomscrolling through (mostly same) items sorted by discount percentage every day, I created a script that only shows new arrivals. The target online store shall remain a secret. I run this script every few days as a cron job to stay updated.

Maybe will add email sending, maybe not? I'm not that addicted for those discounts..
